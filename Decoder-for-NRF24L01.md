[NRF](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/2-4-GHz-proprietary) is a proprietary low-power and low-cost transceiver in the 2.4Ghz range produced by Nordic Semiconductor. It  mainly used for remotes, keyboards and mice and in general low power comunication. It is often seen as nFR24L01 and similar cheap transceivers popular with the hobby electronics crowd. It is also popular in radio control of mini-drone.

With this app, you can use portapack to decode the data sent from NRF24L01, and also  see some data messages  in 2.4GHz. I currently supports only 250KPS mode.
