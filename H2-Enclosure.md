If you do not own a 3d printer, you have other options:

* [Weerg](https://www.weerg.com) for a high quality print
* [3DHubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) for a low cost alternative
* [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/daddy-makes-stuff-and-things/hackrf-portapack-h2-case/) another alternative, with a lot of customization options
* [Injection moulded](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9ybXDz) version of the case

# Assembly
Check the `assembly.pdf` from the [case files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4260973/files) for instructions.

## Speaker

You can easily place a small 8ohm 1.5W (14x21x5.5 mm) speaker inside. There is no holes in the case but it seems that the sound quality actually improves with the case:
