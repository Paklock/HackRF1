If you do not own a 3d printer, you could use a service like https://www.weerg.com for a high quality print, or https://www.3dhubs.com/ for a low cost alternative. 

# Assembly
Check the `assembly.pdf` from the [case files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4260973/files) for instructions.

## Speaker

You can easily place a small 8ohm 1.5W (14x21x5.5 mm) speaker inside. There is no holes in the case but it seems that the sound quality actually improves with the case:
