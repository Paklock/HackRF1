The Following are tips on how to care for your PortaPack/HackRF:

* Do not pack the PortaPack with heavy or blunt objects. The LCD display is easy to crush, scratched  and damaged. The touch screen glass is not smartphone glass, and is therefore  a lot more fragile.

* Keep the unit away from water and dont keep in a damp enviroment.

* The RF input to the antenna is very sensitive to RF level.Do not overload or place in an environment that has high RF levels otherwise the front end amplifier will be damaged, this has happenend to a lot of people.

* If transmitting make sure you have an Antenna or RF load conected to the Antenna connection of nominal 50 Ohms and has a VSWR less than 2:1. 

* Do not overtighten RF cables to the HackRF SMA connectors. If you tighten too much, the SMA connector can snap off the HackRF board.

* Disconnect all cables and connectors before storing your PortaPack. Sideways force on plugs can loosen and damage PortaPack and HackRF connectors.
