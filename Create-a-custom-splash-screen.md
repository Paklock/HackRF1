Are you bored of the standard power on screen?
Do you want your own image at power up to personalise your device?
You can!

Save a 240x304 24-bit BMP file named `splash.bmp` in the root of the SD card. You can get ready to use images in the `#splash-screens` channel over our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tuwVMv3) group.

If you don't see any (custom) splash screen, make sure you've switched this on by ticking the box in Options - Interface - Show Splash.
