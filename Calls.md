The Calls mode is similar in functionality to the one on many Uniden scanners.

It allows to define a frequency range to scan (min/max), and a power threshold (trig). If a signal appears above the power threshold for a sufficient amount of time, the signal's frequency is "locked", shown in green and logged in a table at the bottom of the screen.
