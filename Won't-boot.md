If you device won't boot and leaves you on a black or white screen, then you will need to power off the device and then hold down the UP button while you power it on.

If this does not work, then try the same thing but this time holding the down button.

What this is doing is loading a different LCD driver to get your device to work.

Once that is done you should be able to reboot normally without any issues.

* UP key = LCD driver 1
* DOWN key = LCD driver 2
* OK/SELECT key = Reset/Automatic detection

_**Note:** H2+ usually require you to hold down the UP key on the first boot to configure them._

_This is valid from nightly version **n_220406** and stable release version: _**No stable release yet**__
