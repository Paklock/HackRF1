# My device wont start up

## White screen
If you device won't boot and leaves you on white screen, then you will need to power off the device and then hold down the **UP** button while you power it on. This could take up to 10 seconds.

If this does not work, then try the same thing but this time holding the **DOWN** button (Remembering to wait up to 10 seconds).

What this is doing is loading a different LCD driver to get your devices screen to work.

Once that is done you should be able to reboot normally without any issues.

# Black screen
If you device won't boot and leaves you on a black screen, then you will need to power off the device and then hold down the **LEFT** button while you power it on. This could take up to 10 seconds.
