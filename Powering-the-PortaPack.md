# Powering the PortaPack

The Portapack H1 or H2 are powered via the USB 2.0 connector on the HackRF One. In the case of the H2, it can have an internal LiPo battery that can be charged via the USB 2.0 socket. 

The maximum size of battery that can be installed in a typical metal cases is 2500mAh, but 2100mAh would be a better fit.  
Based on testing the Portapack/HackRF consumes between 250mA (1.25W) when just menu screen is on and 550mA peak (2.75W) when audio is at full volume and receiving signals.

In the cases of charging from the USB, then the peak of 1.5 A is seen with the portapack in use though does drop as the charging takes place. The charge rate of the battery is a peak of about 1000mA dropping back to 600mA-700mA and takes between 3-4 hours to charge depending on battery size and the quality of the cable,longer cables will charger slower.

When on an internal battery (say 2500mAh) the Portapack H2, has between 4-5 hours  of life depending on use and battery state.
