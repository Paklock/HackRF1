The Portapack Mayhem Title Bar consists of a number of icons some of which trigger actions and some of which are used to indicate the status of certain subsystems. The Title Bar also contains the either the Application Name or Firmware name and Version in the form **MAYHEM vX.Y.Z** where the versioning is consistent with standard semantic versioning (major.minor.release) format.

Icons that may be actioned can be accessed by touch, or by using the directional buttons (H2) or directional ring (H1) to move the highlight that indicates which Icon is selected. If the highlight is on the Main Menu, using the *up* button will move it to the Title Bar.
