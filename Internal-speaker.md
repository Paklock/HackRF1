The pinout is quite simple.
A speaker has 2 wires, SPK+ and SPK-

At rest, a speaker floats on a magnetic field in the middle of it's range. When SPK+ is high the speaker moves forward. When SPK- is high the speaker moves backwards. The distance forward and backwards depends entirely on the voltage level.

On the PortaPack, the speaker connector has 3 pins.

SPK+ is the pin nearest to the edge of the board
skip the middle
SPK- is towards the centre of the board

When you add the new speaker you may find that there is no audio. By default the speaker is disabled.

To enable the speaker:
Settings
UI Settings
Ensure Hide H1 Speaker option is disabled (a red X)
Click Save

Now a speaker icon will be present on the top line of the display.
If the icon has an X it is muted. You can click on it to unmute, it will turn green.
