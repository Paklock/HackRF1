This Tool was ported from [https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc). Furrtek stated in  17 Apr 2020,that the tool was used to mess around with a particular French brand of laser tag equipment. This tool's name and this last sentence contains enough search terms :). The brand isn't clearly specified because it's a trade mark.
