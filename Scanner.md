# Frequencies to scan

The application parses `FREQMAN\SCANNER.TXT`  by default. You can use the Frequency manager app (Tools -> **Freq managern**) to add more entries to that list. 

Alternatively, you are able to manually input a scanning range "on the fly" by keying in START and END frequencies, while adjusting the STEP selector. 

# Modulation Mode
You can select between **AM** (DSB / USB / LSB), **NFM** and **WFM** modulation modes.
