The Audio Receivers application is a general purpose, protocol-free Receiver Application. This is to say it demodulates the raw modulation but does not do any decoding of the demodulated stream.

The Sub-Applications are as follows:

|Application Name|Functionality|
|----------------|-------------|
|[SPEC](Spectrum-Analyser-Receiver)|General-purpose RF Spectrum viewer/recorder|
|[WFM](Wide-FM-Receiver)|Wide Frequency-Modulation (inc. Stereo FM) demodulator|
|[NFM](Narrow-FM-Receiver)|Narrow Frequency-Modulation demodulator|
|[AM](AM-Receiver)|Amplitude Modulation (inc. Single-Sideband, Double-Sideband) demodulator|
