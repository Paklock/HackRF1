"RDS" stands for "Radio Data System" and it allows FM broadcasters to send far more than just an analogue audio signal out over the air waves. Using a 57 kHz "subcarrier," stations can transmit digital RDS data for reception by RDS-equipped FM tuners. This technology opens up a whole new range of features help to the listener with RDS reception capability. Typical information can you expect depends on what the broadcaster transmits and what your device can pick up. There are two categories, Static and Dynamic. 

A full description of the system is [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System)

## RDS "Static" services include:

Program Service Name (PS): This is a displays a name instead of frequency
Program Type Code (PTY): This identifies a particular type of broadcast (Rock, Jazz, Sports, Talk, News, Classical, etc.) So far, 24 categories have been defined and assigned but the RDS system 
Program Identification Codes (PI): Is a four-digit hexadecimal code. It is allocated on a country basis and usually made up of a Country Identifier followed by 3 ID unique characters   is a This is one of the rarely-seen "hidden" RDS features 
Alternate Frequency (AF): If PI is one of RDS’ "back office" functions, AF is what you’ll see in action all the time. Alternate Frequency Switching AF automatically returns your FM tuner to the strongest signal carrying that program.
Traffic Program (TP): This symbol alerts you to the fact that the station you’re listening too regularly broadcasts special traffic information. Think of TP as the "indicator " for Traffic Announcement (TA). 

## RDS "Dynamic" services:

Traffic Announcement (TA): This is the active side of TP capability. This guarantees up-to-the-minute information sent to the driver.
Radio Text (RT): This feature allows a broadcaster to send up to a 64-character message that could scroll across your radio’s display, things like sports scores, song titles, artist or album names, even advertisements.
Clock Time (CT): An RDS-equipped station broadcasts a time and date synch signal once a minute. 
Emergency Alert System (EAS): PTY code # 31 If your RDS tuner senses an emergency code, it will flash an ALERT message.
