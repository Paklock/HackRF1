If enabled (green), transmitting will be done with the screen's backlight off. The TX LED will also be blinking once per second to indicate activity. Force the backlight on again by pressing any button.

Currently this function is not active on *all* transmit applications.

The setting of stealth mode held in persistent memory and may need to be reset after a firmware upgrade.
