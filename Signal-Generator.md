The signal generator found under Utilities can be used to generate a carrier which can be FM modulated with
* CW : unmodulated carrier
* Sine 
* triangle
* sawtooth up
* sawtooth down
* square
* noise : does not appear to function

Shape defines the generated waveform as above
Tone defines the frequency of modulation
Update. When unchecked, the user is required to drop carrier, then re-start carrier in order for a change of modulation shape or tone frequency to take effect. When checked, values will update on the fly.
Stop after 1s limits carrier duration to 1 second
