The signal generator found under Utilities can be used to generate a carrier which can be FM modulated with the following waveforms as defined by the Shape function.
* CW : unmodulated carrier
* Sine 
* triangle
* sawtooth up
* sawtooth down
* square
* noise : does not appear to function

Tone defines the frequency of modulation.

Update when unchecked requires the user to drop carrier, then re-start carrier in order for a change of modulation Shape or Tone frequency to take effect. When checked, values will update on the fly.

Stop after 1s limits carrier duration to 1 second
